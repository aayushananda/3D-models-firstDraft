# Next.js 3D Model Viewer

An interactive 3D model viewer built with Next.js 15 and Three.js, featuring the Star Trek Enterprise spaceship model. This application demonstrates advanced 3D web techniques including custom lighting, camera controls, environment mapping, and interactive animations.

## Key Features

- Interactive 3D model viewing with intuitive camera controls
- Custom lighting and environment settings for realistic rendering
- Responsive design that works across devices
- Optimized performance with React Suspense and proper resource management
- Modern UI with smooth animations and transitions
- Configurable model properties (scale, position, rotation, shadows)

## Technologies

- Next.js 15
- React 19
- Three.js with React Three Fiber
- GSAP for animations
- TailwindCSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety

This project serves as both a showcase and a starting point for developers looking to implement 3D models in their web applications.
